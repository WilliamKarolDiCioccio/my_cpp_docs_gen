# MyCPPDocsGen

**MyCPPDocsGen** is a fast and lightweight Markdown documentation generator for C++ projects, designed to be compatible with Doxygen-style comments.

This project was created out of the need for a simple, embeddable documentation tool that integrates seamlessly with modern static sites and external frameworks, such as **Astro + Starlight**, without the overhead of traditional tools.

It is currently being developed as part of the [Mosaic game engine](https://github.com/Wilielmus/mosaic) project.
